		<h2> Site intent</h2>

			<p> The object of this redesign is to reorganize the information currently on the website to make it more streamline and professional looking, as well as creating a more user friendly UI (user-interface).  </p>

			<p>The information on the current website will be condensed and rearranged to take the website from 12 pages to 6. Which will not only help with the loading speed and hosting cost of the website but will also make finding information faster and more convenient for the user. </p>

		<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
		<aside>
			<h3> Search Engine Keywords </h3>
			<p>animal hospital, veterinary hospital charlotte nc, Animal practice, pet care, animal care, vet emergency, quality animal hospital </p>
		</aside>
			<p> Local competitors websites: </p>
			<ul> 
				<li><a href=”http://www.dilworthanimalhospital.com/”> Dilworth animal hospital</a> </li>
				<li><a href=”http://www.longanimal.com/”> Long Animal hospital </a>
				<li><a href=”http://www.commonwealthanimalhospital.net/”> Common Wealth animal hospital </a> </li>
			</ul>
			<p>After looking at the local competitors websites several things stood out. Including the fact that they all had their contact information on every page, furthermore each competing site had easy to use navigation tools. Most had clean lines with light colors and one site <em>also</em> featured a mobile version.  </p>

			<p>It’s also important to note that there was only one website that even <em>had</em> enough traffic to perform an analysis for which was Dilworth hospital. It promotes itself as a holistic healing center that was put together based on the local communities needs.  </p>

		<h2>Targeted audience </h2>

			<p> The main point of this website is to be an information pamphlet for the business. So generally speaking there are two groups of people who are going to using it the most. </p>

			<p> First the New Customer. This person is going to be 18-40, local to the area, and own pets. Generally speaking this person will either be a new resident or someone who is looking for a more family styled vet. When visiting our website they are going to be looking for three main things – where is it/how do we contact you, what services do you provide/what types of animals can be seen, and do I need an appointment. </p>

			<p> Second is a Returning Customer. This is someone who has already had his or her first appointment and has decided if this is the vet for them. Usually speaking someone who is visiting again for a second (or third) time is there to check on contact information, links to more information on pets, and to possibly leave a review.  </p>
