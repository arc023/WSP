<p>
If you are new to our practice, we look forward to meeting you and your pet(s) and want to make sure your visit is comfortable and pleasant. We work by appointment in order to minimizewait times and to provide as much times as needed to assess and treat every patient.
Our client services team will be happy to assist you in scheduling a convenient appointment time.
</p>
<p>
We recommend pet carriers for cats (and some smaller dogs) and leashes for dogs. The street and parking lot can be busy and pets may get very excited by all the activity. If other pets bother your pet, let the client services team know in advance and we can minimize or eliminate the time your pet spends in reception.
</p>
<p>
During the examination and treatment of your pet, a member of the nursing team will assist the doctor. They are trained to safely and comfortable restrain your pet. Mist pets will respond better to restraint by someone other than the owner. It works best when the owner remains relaxed and in view of the patient during the examination.
</p>
<p>
After your appointment, our staff can check you out either at the reception counter, or in the exam room. They are also happy to assist getting your pets to and from your car.
