		<h2> Site intent</h2>

			<p> The object of this redesign is to reorganize the information currently on the website to make it easier (and faster) to find the desired information that a new customer might need.  
			The current website itself does not contain a huge amount of unneeded information, it simply needs reorganized and cleaned up to shorten the amount of clicks it takes to figure out where they are, as well as look/feel more professional. </p>

		<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
			<p>Search words commonly used:</p>
		
			<ul> 
				<li> animal hospital</li>
				<li> veterinary hospital charlotte nc </nc>
				<li> Animal practice</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p> Local competitors websites: </p>
			<ul> 
				<li><a href=”http://www.dilworthanimalhospital.com/”> Dilworth animal hospital</a> </li>
				<li><a href=”http://www.longanimal.com/”> Long Animal hospital </a>
				<li><a href=”http://www.commonwealthanimalhospital.net/”> Common Wealth animal hospital </a> </li>
			</ul>
			<p>After looking at the local competitors websites several things stood out. First they all had their contact information on the front page, and second all had easy to use navigation. Most had clean lines with light colors, and one had a mobile version.  </p>

			<p>It’s also important to note that there was only one website that even <em>had</em> enough traffic to perform an analysis for which was Dilworth hospital. It promotes itself as a holistic healing center that was put together based on the local communities needs.  </p>

		<h2>Targeted audience </h2>

			<p> The main point of this website is to be an information pamphlet for the business. So generally speaking there are two groups of people who are going to using it the most. </p>

			<p> First the New Customer. This person is going to be 18-40, local to the area, and own pets. Generally speaking this person will either be a new resident or someone who is looking for a more family styled vet. When visiting our website they are going to be looking for three main things – where is it/how do we contact you, what services do you provide/what types of animals can be seen, and do I need an appointment. </p>

			<p> Second is a Returning Customer. This is someone who has already had his or her first appointment and has decided if this is the vet for them. Usually speaking someone who is visiting again for a second (or third) time is there to check on contact information, links to more information on pets, and to possibly leave a review.  </p>
